\comment {\ref {#se} {Symbolic execution} approach originally outlined here.}

\page {1} \abbr {EFFIGY}â€”symbolic executor for \abbr {PL/I}. This work is for program analysis without formal specification. They assume, the program is correct on the sample if it produses correct results on it.

Two extreme alternatives\: \term {program testing} and \term {program proving} (e.g. formal analysis). Proving doesn't need program execution. \comment {So, is it always static?} \abbr {SE} is between these two alternatives.
