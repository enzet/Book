\paperblock {scalpel}

\page {1} A framework for static analysis of Python programs.

\page {3} They rewrite source code before analysis. Five simplification rule:
\list
    {unfold comprehension,}
    {unfold nested fucntion calls,}
    {simplify subscribtions,}
    {\m {lambda} â†’ \m {def},}
    {split call chains.}

\page {8} Function identifiers are full function name including all nested modules plus basic block number.
